ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iva. I'm a research scientist with a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. <br>
ðŸŒ± I primarily use R and Python for data visualization, and I'm particularly interested in spatial data visualization.
I'm currently learning d3.js to build interactive visualizations and further developing generative art skills in R/ggplot. <br><br>
You can find more about me [on my website](https://ivabrunec.github.io/).
